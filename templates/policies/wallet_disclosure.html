  <h1>Wallet Disclosure</h1>

  <p>
    BeatFund is a software platform that provides tools for creator marketplaces, bookings, and payment workflows.
    <strong>BeatFund is not a bank.</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>Payments & payouts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Payments are processed by third-party providers</strong> (e.g., Stripe) when enabled.</li>
    <li>BeatFund does not store full card numbers or full bank account details.</li>
    <li>Wallet balances are platform balances for using BeatFund features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>No FDIC insurance</h2>
  <p>
    Unless explicitly stated otherwise for a specific payment product and program, <strong>wallet balances are not FDIC insured</strong>
    and are not deposits in a bank account.
  </p>

  <h2>Use within BeatFund</h2>
  <p>
    Keep communication and payments inside BeatFund. Do not share contact or payment information to move transactions
    off-platform. This helps prevent fraud and supports dispute handling.
  </p>

  <h2>Disputes & refunds</h2>
  <p>
    See our dispute and refund policies for how chargebacks, refunds, and booking disputes are handled.
