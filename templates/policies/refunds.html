  <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
  
  <p>
    This policy explains how refunds and cancellations work across marketplace purchases and service bookings.
    <strong>BeatFund is not a bank</strong>. When enabled, card payments are processed by third-party providers (e.g., Stripe).
  </p>

  <h2>Marketplace (digital goods)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Refund eligibility depends on licensing terms and whether deliverables have been provided/downloaded.</li>
    <li>Digital goods may be non-refundable once delivered unless required by law or due to verified fraud.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Bookings (services)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cancellation/refund eligibility depends on booking status, timing, and evidence of non-delivery.</li>
    <li>Providers and clients should attempt resolution in-chat before escalating.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Hold fee mechanics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Some bookings may require a hold fee that is held until completion or dispute resolution.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Fees</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Platform fees and processor fees (if any) may be non-refundable once a transaction completes.</li>
    <li>Any fees will be disclosed before checkout.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Chargebacks and account restrictions</h2>
