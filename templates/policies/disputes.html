  <h1>Dispute & Chargeback Policy</h1>
  
  <p>
    This policy describes how disputes are handled for marketplace purchases and service bookings.
    <strong>BeatFund is not a bank</strong>. When enabled, payments are processed by third-party providers (e.g., Stripe).
  </p>

  <h2>General process</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Parties should attempt resolution directly using BeatFund chat and platform tools.</li>
    <li>If unresolved, BeatFund may request evidence (messages, delivery details, timestamps, files).</li>
    <li>BeatFund may apply temporary holds or restrictions while investigating.</li>
    <li>Decisions are made to protect platform integrity and reduce fraud/abuse.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Service delivery disputes (bookings)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Disputes may consider booking status, communications, and any proof of delivery/non-delivery.</li>
    <li>Hold fees (if applicable) may be released, refunded, or forfeited depending on outcome.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Digital goods disputes (marketplace)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Disputes may consider licensing terms and whether deliverables were provided/downloaded.</li>
    <li>Refund outcomes can be limited once a deliverable is provided, except where required by law or for verified fraud.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Chargebacks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Chargebacks can result in temporary holds, refunds, and account restrictions.</li>
    <li>Repeated chargebacks or suspected fraud may lead to suspension or permanent removal.</li>
  </ul>
