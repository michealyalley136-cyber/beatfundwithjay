  <h1>Risk Disclosure (VERY IMPORTANT)</h1>
  
  <p>Using BeatFund involves risk. Please read this carefully before using the wallet, marketplace, or booking features.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Funding a creator does not guarantee results or returns</li>
    <li>Projects may fail or be delayed</li>
    <li><strong>BeatFund is not a bank</strong> and does not insure wallet balances</li>
    <li><strong>Wallet balances are not FDIC insured</strong> and are not bank deposits</li>
    <li>Users may lose money</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Marketplace (digital goods)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Digital goods (beats, licenses, deliverables) may have licensing limitations and usage restrictions.</li>
    <li>Once a deliverable is provided, refunds may be limited based on the Refund & Cancellation Policy.</li>
    <li>Exclusive items can become unavailable after purchase.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Bookings (services)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>BeatFund does not guarantee service delivery, outcomes, or satisfaction between clients and providers.</li>
    <li>Disputes may require evidence and can result in holds, refunds, or account restrictions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Hold fees (escrow-like mechanics)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Some bookings may require a hold fee that is held until booking completion or dispute resolution.</li>
    <li>Hold fees may be released, refunded, or forfeited depending on outcomes and policy rules.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Payments, chargebacks, and restrictions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>When enabled, card payments are processed by third-party processors (e.g., Stripe). BeatFund does not store full card numbers.</li>
    <li>Chargebacks and disputes can result in temporary holds, refunds, and account restrictions.</li>
    <li>Accounts may be limited or frozen to comply with fraud prevention and legal obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You should only use funds you can afford to lose.</p>
